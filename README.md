Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting Project
This project is based on the Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting competition hosted on Kaggle. The goal of this project is to predict the number of future visitors to a restaurant, using historical visit data and other relevant features. Accurate forecasts are vital for restaurant owners and managers as they help in efficient resource management, including inventory planning, staffing, and overall operational efficiency.

Project Overview
The project involves building machine learning models to forecast daily restaurant visitors. It utilizes various data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, and model tuning to achieve accurate predictions. The models are evaluated based on their performance metrics, and the best-performing model is selected for the final prediction.

Key Components
1) Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values

Data normalization and transformation

Feature engineering to create meaningful features from raw data

2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing data trends and patterns using tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib

Identifying important features and their relationships with the target variable

3) Modeling:

Building and tuning multiple models, including XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Prophet

Comparing model performance using cross-validation and other metrics

Selecting the best model based on prediction accuracy

4) Evaluation:

Evaluating models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and others

Fine-tuning the models to improve their performance

5) Visualization:

Visualizing the results and predictions using libraries like Folium and Joypy

Creating interactive plots to better understand model performance and data distribution
